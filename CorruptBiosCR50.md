anyways  
> [!CAUTION]
> Theres a very good chance this should work but if it doesnt, you now own a frisbee you can use because your bios is done for as far as i know.
  
## TL;DR
This will attempt to replace the current corrupted bios with the backup you created (hopefully)  
  
## TUTORIAL
**UNPLUG CHARGER**  

Put the chip clip back on  
  
Restart NeoProgrammer  
  
Detect the chip  
  
Click Read IC  
  
Click Unprotect  
  
Open your back up file via the Open file button  
    
Click Erase IC  

Click Write IC  
  
Once done, remove the chip clip and plug in your charger, if it doesnt boot, try to plug the battery back in, if it STILL doesnt boot.. RIP.
